C-- scanner

Requirements:  use lookup(), insertID() and printSymTab() to handle all identifiers.
1. Print each comment
2. Print the frequency of each identifier
   1) operators, 2) separators, 3) identifiers, 4) reserved words and 5) constants
   Identifiers are strings of one or more letters, digits and underscore characters. They must begin with a letter.
   
outputs should be sorted. You could simply use the strcmp
?????? the entire " (double quote) delimited string is treated as a single token i.e. a string constant
your scanner should issue an error message, and print out the unrecognized token, then exit.
names will not exceed 64 characters
number of distinct identifiers should not be limited
