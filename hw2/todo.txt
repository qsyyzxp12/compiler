C-- scanner
use basic symbol table manipulation routines (lookup(), insertID() and printSymTab()) provided to handle all identifiers. 
1) operators, 2) separators, 3) identifiers, 4) reserved words and 5) constants
Comments are considered as white spaces, and should be stripped off
required to define comments as a token, just to practice RE writing skills

only needs to handle the following jobs:
1. Print each comment captured by your token RE (regular expression
2. Print the frequency of each identifier

a) It is required that the outputs be sorted. You could simply use the strcmp library function to do the sorting
b) the entire " (double quote) delimited string is treated as a single token i.e. a string constant. In the case of some unknown tokens, your scanner should issue an error message, and print out the unrecognized token, then exit.
c) names will not exceed 64 characters. However, the number of distinct identifiers should not be limited.
d) In the hw2  directory you may find the following files:
1) src/lexer.l 		 the lex template code that you may start with
2) src/symboltable.c	 contains symbol table manipulation routines
3) src/header.h		 	  contains a sample symbol table structure
4) src/Makefile
5) test/			a test directory containing some sample tests
6) tar.sh			  package script
