C-- scanner

The output from your scanner looks like the following:

/* 1: this is * just a / sample */
/* 2: this is a 3-line
   comment
*/
/* 3: this is /* the end ***/

Frequency of identifiers:
a1	     1
abc		4


Requirements:  use lookup(), insertID() and printSymTab() to handle all identifiers.
1. Print each comment
2. Print the frequency of each identifier
   1) operators, 2) separators, 3) identifiers, 4) reserved words and 5) constants
   Identifiers are strings of one or more letters, digits and underscore characters. They must begin with a letter.
   
outputs should be sorted
?????? the entire " (double quote) delimited string is treated as a single token i.e. a string constant
TODO: should issue an error message, and print out the unrecognized token, then exit.
names will not exceed 64 characters
number of distinct identifiers should not be limited

TODO: should issue an error message, and print out the unrecognized token, then exit.
      after error, should still continue???
OK: put list in array, to additional link(that make structure changes)
TODO: reserved word -> look as ID
TODO: check output format, add more test data
TODO: test on linux
